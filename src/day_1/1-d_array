The Dutch National Algorithm is used to
answer questions related to sorting an array
containing only three distinct elements or
partitioning an array into three distinct
categories. The most common example is
sorting an array of Os, 1s, and 2s, where the
algorithm places all Os at the beginning, 1s in
the middle, and 2s at the end in a single
pass.

Problem type:

Three-way partitioning:
    The algorithm partitions elements into three
    groups based on their value or condition,
    similar to the three colors of the Dutch
    national flag.

    Sorting an array with three distinct values:
    The canonical problem involves sorting ar
    array containing only Os, 1s, and 2s.
