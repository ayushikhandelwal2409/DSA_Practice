                                                                       |------>JRE consist of JVM(Java Virtual Machine) and library
//static vs non static
Static is a pre defined keyword Which means for a particular variable it would have the same value everywhere in that class(common for all object)
A non static in this we can take different values for the variable in it(not common for all object)
// static block always runs first.
//In a static field we can't access non static things but vice versa is possible.


//access modifier:-
//public==everywhere
//private==in class only
//protected==in a package+ subclasses
//default==in a package
//we can use getter and setter methods to set or get something

//Data Structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

//OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming System) is a programming approach that organizes code using objects and classes. It helps structure software by modeling real-world things, making the code more reusable, manageable, and scalable.
//It is based on four key concepts: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

//An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem or perform a task.

            Search for something (e.g., Binary Search)

            Sort data (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort)

            Traverse structures (e.g., Trees, Graphs)

            Optimize solutions (e.g., Dijkstra’s for shortest path)

            Solve complex problems efficiently (e.g., Dynamic Programming)


//Why are Algorithms Used?
       1. To solve problems efficiently.
       2. To optimize performance (speed, memory, etc.).

Feature	    Array	                                    ArrayList
Size	    Fixed at creation time	                    Grows/shrinks dynamically
Type	    Can hold both primitives and objects	    Can only hold objects (e.g., Integer, not int)
            No built-in methods for adding/removing 	Has built-in methods like add(), remove(), contains()

Feature	        String	                                                            StringBuilder
Mutability	    Immutable (cannot change once created)	                            Mutable (can be changed)
Performance	    Slower in repetitive operations (like concatenation in loops)	    Faster for heavy string modifications
Memory Usage	Creates new objects for every change	                            Uses same object, so more memory efficient for changes

Feature | Overloading | Overriding
Definition | Same method name, different parameters | Same method signature in child class

4 oops pillars ==>

Encapsulation
Binding data and methods into a single unit (like a class).
Example: Making fields private and accessing them via getters/setters.

Abstraction
Hiding unnecessary details from the user.
Example: You use a car.start() without knowing how the engine works inside.

Inheritance
One class inherits properties and behavior from another.
Example: Dog inherits from Animal.

Polymorphism
One interface, many forms. Method overloading and overriding.
Example: draw() method behaves differently in Circle vs Square.



1. What is the difference between class and object?
Answer:
Class: Blueprint or template (e.g., Car).
Object: Instance of a class (e.g., Car myCar = new Car();).


inheritance==> extend
encapsulation ==> classes form
abstraction ==>interface



Modifier | Access Level
private | Within the same class only
default | Within the same package
protected | Same package + subclasses
public | Anywhere


8. Can you explain constructor overloading?
Answer: Yes! Having multiple constructors with different parameter lists in the same class.

class Car {
    Car() { }  // default constructor
    Car(String model) { }  // parameterized constructor
}


10. What is constructor chaining?
Answer:
When one constructor calls another constructor in the same or parent class using this() or super().

class Car {
    Car() { this("Default"); }
    Car(String model) { System.out.println(model); }
}


11. What is the difference between this and super?
Answer:
Keyword	Purpose
this	Refers to the current class instance
super	Refers to the parent class instance


12. What is a final class, method, and variable in Java?
Answer:
final class → Cannot be inherited.
final method → Cannot be overridden.
final variable → Acts as a constant, can't be reassigned.



13. Can you override a static method?
Answer:
No. Static methods belong to the class, not objects. So they are hidden, not overridden.



18. Can a class implement multiple interfaces in Java?
Answer:
✅ Yes! Java allows a class to implement multiple interfaces, enabling multiple inheritance behavior.
class A implements Interface1, Interface2 { }
19. Can a class extend an abstract class and implement an interface at the same time?
Answer:
✅ Yes! A class can extend one abstract class and implement multiple interfaces.
class MyClass extends MyAbstract implements Interface1, Interface2 { }


//An abstract class in Java:
        1.Is declared using the abstract keyword.
        2.Cannot be instantiated.
        3.Can have abstract methods (without body) and concrete methods (with body).
        4.Is meant to be extended by subclasses, which must implement the abstract methods.



// Abstract class
abstract class Animal {
    // Abstract method (no body)
    abstract void makeSound();

    // Concrete method
    void breathe() {
        System.out.println("Breathing...");
    }
}

// Subclass (inherits from Animal)
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Must implement abstract method
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Animal a = new Animal(); // ❌ Error: Cannot instantiate abstract class
        Dog d = new Dog();          // ✅ OK
        d.makeSound();              // Woof!
        d.breathe();                // Breathing...
    }
}
